#### Project Notes

This is one of my first video game prototypes. It's built using Construct 2, a game design engine that allows you to code by fitting together logic blocks.

This was a really neat project that taught me a lot about tilemapping, loops, and game mechanics.

Sprites and tiles for this prototype were provided by the amazing [Kenney](http://www.kenney.nl).

####Future Plans

I need to build a boss so that players can actually "win" the game. The boss will need:

* Basic AI
* Life Counter
* Battle Effects (screen shake whenever it jumps?)
* Win screen to be displayed after it's defeated

I am always looking to learn and grow as a programmer. If you have suggestions or want to learn together, feel free to contact me!
